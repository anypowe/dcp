#problem description: Given an array of integers, 
#	find the 1st missing positive integer in O(n) & constant space.
#	I.e. find the lowest positive integer not in the array.
#	The array can contain duplicates and negatives
#
#	E.g. [3,4,-1,1] -> 2
#	E.g. [1,2,0] -> 3
#
#approached from one described here:
#https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-the-smallest-positive-number-missing-from-an-unsorted-array/
# "We use array elements as index. To mark presence of an element x, 
# we change the value at the index x to negative. But this approach 
# doesnâ€™t work if there are non-positive (-ve and  numbers. So we 
# segregate positive from negative numbers as first step and then apply the approach."
#

#swap()
#simple swap for two indices a,b of an array
#returns updated array
def swap(array, a, b):
	temp_a = array[a]
	array[a] = array[b]
	array[b] = temp_a
	return array
#end swap()

#update_irrel()
#returns the newly updated index just before the irrelevant value section
def update_irrel(array, irrel):
	while (array[irrel] < 1) or (array[irrel] > len(array)) : 
		if irrel == 0:
			break
		else:   
			irrel = irrel - 1
	return irrel
#end irrel

#partial_sort(array)
#first pass of the array to partially sort relevant values from irrelevant ones:
#a relevant value is a positive integer < len(array) + 1: O(n)
#
#input: original array to check
#postconditions: array is partially sorted, returns last index before irrel section
#
#this could be optimized more by making another pass and pushing more values to the irrel section;	
#since we now know the lengths of the relevant and irrelevant sections, values > len(rel_section)
#are no longer relevant: e.g, [2,1,6,1,-3,-3,-2,1]
#at first, only -3,-2 are irrelevant; after the first pass, we see the len of rel section < 6, 
#and it is shown to be irrelevant at this point
def partial_sort(array):
	i = 0 
	irrel = len(array) - 1 #last index before the irrel section starting from the end
	irrel = update_irrel(array,irrel) #if the last is irrel, update until reaching an index with +rel

	#move i from beginning to until it reaches the irrel section, 
	#swapping irrels's, and updating the irrel...
	while i < irrel:
		if (array[i] < 1) or (array[i] > len(array)): #if a swap is needed
			swap(array,i,irrel)	
			irrel = update_irrel(array,irrel) #update the dividing index
		if i == irrel:  #if i is at the at the last relevant value (bc of the updating)
			pass
		else:
			i = i + 1
	
	if i == len(array) - 1:
		i = -1  #code for all rels's
	elif (i == 0) and (array[i] < 1):
		i = -2 #code for all irrel's
	
	#array is partially sorted
	return i #i is the index where the irrels's start
#end partial_sort()


#find_int(array_irrel)
#
#Using the technique described above, we'll use the index to look for the missing int
#go through rel list (i.e. vals within index of array), and change:
#array[i-1] = -(array[i-1]), i.e. the negative indicates the value for that index is present
#at the end, the lowest index with a positive value (in the rel section), is the missing value.
#If all are negative, the array contains all consecutive pos ints from 1 -> len(array), 
#and the next value is that + 1.
#this could be optimized more by making another pass and pushing more values to the irrel section;
#since we now know the lengths of the relevant and irrelevant sections, values > len(rel_section)
#are no longer relevant: e.g, [2,1,6,1,-3,-3,-2,1]
#at first, only -3,-2 are irrelevant; after the first pass, we see the len of rel section < 6, 
#and it is shown to be irrelevant at this point
